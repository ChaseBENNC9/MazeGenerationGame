# 3) Maze Generation - Maze Game.
This is the third game in the ID623001-introduction-to-algorithmic-problem-solving portfollio. It Randomly generates a 
3d maze the player can move through in a first person perspective. The Player is trying to get to a goal at the end of the 
maze while avoiding the enemy that uses pathfinding to track the player. 

# Advanced Assessment Tasks
The Player can track the goal by pressing 'f'. A path of floating spheres appears in front of the player leading to the goal using the
same method the AI uses to track the player. No external research was 
required to complete this task because it uses existing methods in the script.
